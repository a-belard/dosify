Dosify 💊🤖

Smart AI-Powered Medication Organizer
Dosify combines Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Robotics to automate medication management and improve accessibility for people with disabilities. The system reads prescriptions, generates medication schedules, and uses a robotic arm to sort pills into the correct organizer compartments.

Project Overview:

Managing medications can be challenging, especially for individuals with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or complex medication schedules. Dosify addresses this challenge by automating the entire medication preparation process.

The user places a prescription beneath the camera, the system extracts medication information using AI-powered OCR, generates a personalized schedule, and instructs a robotic arm to organize the correct pills into designated compartments.

Our primary goal during prototype development was to validate the most critical assumption: Can the robotic arm reliably pick and place pills?

By focusing on robotic manipulation first, we ensured that the foundation of the system was practical before expanding the AI and scheduling components.
